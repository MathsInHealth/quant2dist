\title{Fit parametric distributions to reported quantile data}
\usage{
q2d(samp, justbest = TRUE, hessian = FALSE, tol = 8, return_df = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{samp}{A named numeric vector of quantile values. Names should be
quantile labels such as \code{"25\%"}, \code{"50\%"}, \code{"min"},
\code{"max"}, and must include \code{"n"} for sample size. May also
include \code{"mean"}, \code{"sd"}, or \code{"se"}.}

\item{justbest}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), return only the
best-fitting distribution. If \code{FALSE}, return results for all six.}

\item{hessian}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, compute the Hessian matrix at the
optimum for each distribution.}

\item{tol}{Integer; number of decimal places for comparing log-likelihoods
when selecting the best distribution (default 8).}

\item{return_df}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, return results as a data frame.}
}
\value{
If \code{justbest = TRUE} and \code{return_df = FALSE} (default),
a named numeric vector of moments, quantiles, and parameters for the
best-fitting distribution. If \code{return_df = TRUE}, a data frame
with one row per distribution (or just the best). The result has an
attribute \code{"vector"} containing the original input.
}
\description{
Fits six parametric distribution families (normal, lognormal, exponential,
beta, gamma, Weibull) to quantile-reported summary statistics using maximum
likelihood estimation, and selects the best-fitting distribution.
}
\examples{
# Fit to IQR + median
q2d(c("25\%" = 10, "50\%" = 15, "75\%" = 20, n = 100))

# Fit to 5-number summary
q2d(c(min = 2, "25\%" = 10, "50\%" = 15, "75\%" = 20, max = 35, n = 100))

# Return all distributions as a data frame
q2d(c("25\%" = 10, "50\%" = 15, "75\%" = 20, n = 100),
    justbest = FALSE, return_df = TRUE)
