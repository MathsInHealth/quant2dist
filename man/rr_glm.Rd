\title{Fit a relative risk regression model using logistic approximation}
\usage{
rr_glm(formula, data, weights = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the model (e.g., \code{outcome ~ predictor}).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in \code{formula}.}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of case weights, or a single value (default 1)
applied to all observations.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the coefficient table with sandwich-adjusted
standard errors, z-statistics, and p-values. Rows correspond to model
terms (intercept, predictors); columns are Estimate, Std. Error, z value, Pr(>|z|).
}
\description{
Estimates relative risks (rather than odds ratios) from binary outcome data
using the case duplication method with sandwich variance adjustment.
Standard logistic regression on duplicated data approximates the RR,
and robust standard errors account for the induced correlation.
}
\details{
This function duplicates all cases where the outcome equals 1, setting
the outcome to 0 in the duplicates, then fits a logistic regression model.
The resulting log-odds coefficient approximates log(RR). Standard errors
are corrected using \code{\link{zl_sandwich}} to account for the case duplication.

An \code{id} column is added to \code{data} if not already present to track
original vs. duplicated observations.

\dontrun{
# Simple RR regression
dat <- data.frame(outcome = c(1,1,0,0,1,0), x = c(2,3,1,2,4,1))
rr_glm(outcome ~ x, data = dat)
}
