Description: Recovers parametric distribution parameters from summary
    statistics (quantiles, means, standard deviations) commonly reported
    in medical and scientific literature. Fits normal, lognormal,
    exponential, beta, gamma, and Weibull distributions using maximum
    likelihood estimation and selects the best fit.
